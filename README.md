This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, providing a comprehensive basis for predicting housing prices. The implementation involves exploratory data analysis, visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships. The predictive model is built using Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning for regression tasks. Evaluation metrics, namely Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), are employed to assess the model's performance. The Readme file serves as a guide to understanding the project, outlining the dataset's context, the steps taken in data preprocessing, model training, and the visualizations created for a comprehensive analysis of the predictive model's efficacy.
